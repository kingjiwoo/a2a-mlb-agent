A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that provides comprehensive access to MLB statistics and baseball data through a FastMCP-based interface.

## Overview

This MCP server acts as a bridge between AI applications and MLB data sources, enabling seamless integration of baseball statistics, game information, player data, and more into AI workflows and applications.

## Features

### MLB Data Access
- **Current standings** for all MLB teams with flexible filtering by league, season, and date
- **Game schedules** and results with date range support
- **Player statistics** including traditional and sabermetric stats (WAR, wOBA, wRC+)
- **Team information** and rosters with various roster types
- **Live game data** including boxscores, linescores, and play-by-play
- **Game highlights** and scoring plays
- **Player and team search** functionality
- **Draft information** and award recipients
- **Game pace statistics** and lineup information

### MCP Tools

All MLB/statistics/game/player/team/etc. functionality is exposed as MCP tools, not as RESTful HTTP endpoints. These tools are accessible via the `/mcp/` endpoint using the MCP protocol. For a list of available tools and their descriptions, visit `/tools/` when the server is running.

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 mlb-api-mcp
```

#### Setting the Timezone

To run the container in your local timezone, pass the `TZ` environment variable (e.g., for New York):

```bash
docker run -e TZ=America/New_York -p 8000:8000 mlb-api-mcp
```

Replace `America/New_York` with your desired [IANA timezone name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with:
- **MCP Server**: `http://localhost:8000/mcp/`
- **Documentation**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

#### Docker Options

You can also run the container with additional options:

```bash
# Run in detached mode
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name mlb-api-server mlb-api-mcp

# Run with custom port mapping
docker run -p 3000:8000 mlb-api-mcp

# View logs

```

### Coverage

- **Current Coverage**: 86.27% (exceeds 80% threshold)
- **Coverage Source**: `mlb_api.py` and `generic_api.py`
- **Reports**: Terminal output, HTML (`htmlcov/index.html`), and XML (`coverage.xml`)
- **CI Integration**: Coverage checking and badge updates run automatically on every push/PR

### Test Structure

The test suite includes:
- **Unit tests** for all MCP tools (MLB API and Generic API)
- **Error handling tests** for API failures
- **Edge case tests** for boundary conditions
- **Mock-based tests** to avoid external API calls

### Adding New Tests

When adding new functionality:

1. Add corresponding test cases to `tests/test_mlb_api.py`
2. Include both success and error scenarios
3. Use mocking to avoid external dependencies
4. Ensure coverage remains above 80%

Example test structure:
```python
def test_new_function_success(mcp):
    """Test successful execution of new function"""
    new_function = get_tool(mcp, 'new_function')
    with patch('mlb_api.external_api_call', return_value={'data': 'success'}):
        result = new_function(param='value')
        assert 'data' in result

def test_new_function_error_handling(mcp):
    """Test error handling in new function"""
    new_function = get_tool(mcp, 'new_function')
    with patch('mlb_api.external_api_call', side_effect=Exception("API Error")):
        result = new_function(param='value')
        assert 'error' in result
```
